# The undefined bug

I decided to update some text on my posts and noticed that my auto-refresh on save wasn't working.
I looked at the console and saw this :

After some reseached I came across this GitHub issue https://github.com/hashicorp/next-remote-watch/issues/14
where somebody had a similar problem.

As somebody (at the link below) mentioned it turns out the internal API for Next.js changed and placed the hotReloader in a nested server object. Works in next js 10. Not compatible with next js 9.
Here's the solution : https://github.com/lukesmurray/next-remote-watch/commit/bbf23298bf990278b293b457601249109878ae08
