# I enrolled into Springboard Bootcamp!

Here's the story.

I started teaching myself how to code back in November 2020. Since I was a complete beginner I started this journey by reading articles about different fields of programming and asking Reddit where to begin.

One day somebody on Reddit recommended checking out Colt Steele's Complete Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy website. It was a 60-hour-long course, where I fell in love with Web Development and programming in general. Even though the course was very long and thorough, of course, I knew I wasn't going to become a competent developer simply finishing one course. I still didn't know anything about front-end frameworks like React, had no idea what SQL was, algorithms, and other things I didn't know that I didn't know.

I started researching what else I needed to know to become a professional developer. According to some job listings, the list was long: at the very least I needed to learn Git, GitHub, React, Redux, SQL, No-SQL, Node.js, Express.js, and much much more.

I started tackling the items on this list one by one by reading documentation, watching tutorials, and YouTube videos. And although I familiarized myself with everything from that long list, I still didn't have a low-level understanding of how these things worked behind the scenes. Since I was a kid I was always very curious about how things worked and why. And I was lacking that deep understanding.

Sometime later in one of the courses, Colt announced that he created this massive 9-month 700-800-hour-long program in partnership
with Springboard and Rithm School, another coding school here in San Francisco. And that's when I told myself - "that's what I need!".

I looked at the benefits of being a Springboard student that included but were not limited to mentorships from industry professionals and career coaching I was confident that if I joined the program I would be able to fill all the gaps in my knowledge and achieve my dream of becoming a professional developer.
